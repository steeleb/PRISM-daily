# PRISM-daily
pipeline for downloading and processing daily PRSIM met data for the EPSCoR-Blooms adjacent Cross Site Gloeo project in R using the prism package for R. 

This pipeline is very slow. The prism package is not ideal for bulk downloads, a year of data downlaod for a single variable of the daily data takes approximately 15 minutes.

Questions should be directed to B. Steele *steeleb@caryinstitute.org*
